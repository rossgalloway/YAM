## Summary (2-5 sentences)
The DVM should support price requests for the YAM/USD price index. In order to do so it will need to support YAM/ETH and ETH/USD price indeces.

## Motivation
The DVM currently does not support the YAMUSD price index.
Supporting the YAMUSD price identifier would enable the creation of the YAMO stablecoin, built using the OpenDAO perpetual stablecoin framework (https://opendao.gitbook.io/whitepaper-v2/) and backed by YAM as collateral. YAM token holders can utilize this as a hedging tool, and could go long or use YAMO for other financial purposes. There is also potential for the YAM DAO itself to use YAM reserves or newly minted tokens as a community backed line of credit to mint YAMO stablecoins to support its mission. There is little cost associated with adding this price identifier, as there are multiple free and easily accessible data sources available.

More information on YAM can be found on the website: https://yam.finance/

## Technical Specification
The definition of this identifier should be:
- Identifier name: YAMUSD
- Base Currency: YAM
- Quote Currency: USD(C)
- Exchanges: Sushiswap
- Result Processing: No processing.
- Input Processing: None. Human intervention in extreme circumstances where the result differs from broad market consensus.
- Price Steps: 0.00001 (5 decimals in more general trading format)
- Rounding: Closest, 0.5 up
- Pricing Interval: 60 seconds
- Dispute timestamp rounding: down



## Rationale

Prices are primarily used by Priceless contracts to calculate a synthetic token’s redemptive value in case of liquidation or expiration. Contract counterparties also use the price index to ensure that sponsors are adequately collateralized. More complex computations (like incorporating additional exchanges, calculating a TWAP or VWAP, or imposing price bands, etc.) have the potential to add a greater level of precision and robustness to the definition of this identifier, particularly at settlement of each expiring synthetic token.

The addition of YAMUSD fits into a larger goal of advancing the adoption of the UMA protocol by allowing YAM to be used as collateral for minting a stable coin among a suite of [OpenDAO](https://opendao.io) stable coins. This furthers adoption of the protocol by encouraging a convergence of capital from different projects and increasing TVL.

Currently the largest exchange with ETH for YAM is [Sushiswap](https://sushiswap.fi/pair/0x0f82e57804d0b1f6fab2370a43dcfad3c7cb239c). If liquidity is withdrawn too fast, there may be a risk in the price peg, and therefore the integrity of the system.

In the current setting, there would need to be a significant event that erodes confidence in YAM and the token, causing Sushiswap liquidity to be withdrawn quickly and en-masse. This threat is mitigated via YAM incentives paid to liquidity providers who stake their tokens.



## Implementation

The value of this identifier for a given timestamp should be determined by querying the price from YAMETH pair https://sushiswap.fi/pair/0x0f82e57804d0b1f6fab2370a43dcfad3c7cb239c on Sushiswap for that timestamp. Most of the YAM trading volume happens on Sushiswap, which forms the broad market consensus. 
While it's important for tokenholders to have redundancy in their sources, bots and users that interact with the system in realtime need fast sources of price information. In these cases, it can be assumed that the price on Sushiswap is accurate enough.

YAM will provide the live price feed on their website publicly, and may offer API access in the future.

## Security considerations
Adding this new identifier by itself poses little security risk to the DVM or priceless financial contract users. However, anyone deploying a new priceless token contract referencing this identifier should take care to parameterize the contract appropriately to the reference asset’s volatility and liquidity characteristics to avoid the loss of funds for synthetic token holders. Additionally, the contract deployer should ensure that there is a network of liquidators and disputers ready to perform the services necessary to keep the contract solvent.
$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting price requests for this identifier and also contemplate de-registering this identifier if security holes are identified. As noted above, $UMA-holders should also consider re-defining this identifier as liquidity in the underlying asset changes, or if added robustness (eg via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.
